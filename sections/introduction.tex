\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Identifying stars in astronomical images and estimating their brightness are fundamental
tasks in astronomy and commonly the first steps in many astronomical analyses. Night sky
images are often contaminated by other sources of light and contain biases that must be
corrected before the images can be analyzed. In this paper, I present approaches to
correct for various sources of bias in astronomical images, identify stars in the images,
estimate their magnitudes and use these magnitudes to do further analysis. The final goal
is to estimate the source-count distribution of stars in the images and compare it to the
literature.

\subsection{Software Library}
\label{sec:software-library}

The methods presented in this paper are implemented in a software library called
\texttt{brightest}. It is designed with a focus on reusability and extensibility, such
that the methods are not optimized for the specific images used in this paper, but can be
applied to any set of astronomical images. The code is written in Python 3.12 and is
available \href{https://github.com/bischoff-m/brightest}{on GitHub} \cite{Bischoff2025}.
The most important libraries used, their versions and their purpose are listed in
\autoref{tab:libraries}. This list represents the current state and may change in the
future.
